### 🧭 Overview
Per 100 is a fast, no-fuss tool that helps you compare prices of anything — groceries, fuel, bulk buys — so you can spot the best deal instantly.  
It’s designed for simplicity and speed: open, type, decide, done.  
You can also **save a comparison** to keep tracking items and continue searching for the best value over time.
